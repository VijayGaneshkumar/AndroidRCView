# AndroidRCView
This application uses a cardview and a recycler view adapter to display a list of news feed items. The endpoint returns the page title
and has the news feed details including a url to download the image.
Have used external libraries like
1. Retrofit : to hit the endpoint and process the json string
2. Picasso : Picasso library to lazy load the images from the url.
3. Butterknife : Used for dependency injection.
4. JUnit and Espresso for unit testing

Further Enhancements
To be planned.
